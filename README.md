# sip-fake-stack

A fake (and incomplete!) SIP stack I use in different security projects. Some features:
- More less ;) valid SIP packet to avoid blocking following [RFC 3261](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt) and its extensions
- TLS, IPv6
- SIP over WS(S) support ([RFC 7118](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7118))
- Partial [SIP Torture](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4475)
- Supported requests: REGISTER, INVITE, OPTIONS, MESSAGE, BYE, CANCEL, ACK, Trying, Ringing, OK, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, PUBLISH
